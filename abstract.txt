Zooplankton are sampled on Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) Transect cruises in summer and winter seasons in oblique tows with a bongo net equipped with two mesh sizes (335 micron and 150 micron). Tows are conducted at standard stations L1 to L11 along longitude 70 deg 53 min W extending southward from near Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, Massachusetts, to approximately 150 km offshore. Counts for taxa morphologically identified from the 335 micron net were provided by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center of the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service. Counts were divided by volume and multiplied by depth sampled for abundance as per meter squared. The first version of this data package provides the abundance of 14 taxa from the 335 micron net for cruises in 2018 - 2020 in a described data table, as well as a supplemental table for the tow metadata.
